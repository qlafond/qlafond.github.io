    <!-- Short Biography -->
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I am a PhD student at the University of Oregon studying pure mathematics. 
      My research interests lie at the intersection of geometry and theoretical physics;
      in particular I am interested in how algebraic and differential geometry play a role 
      in string theory, and quantum field theory.

    <h2>Expository Works</h2>
    The following projects are at various stages of completeness. Please email me with any corrections or questions; I am not infallible, 
    and am bound to have made mistakes along the way.
    <ul>
      <li><a href="Filling in the Gaps.pdf" target="_blank">Algebraic Geometry: Filling in the Gaps</a>
      <span style="font-style: italic;"> This project originally began as my 
        study tool for the Part III algebraic geometry, and abelian varieties exams, and were an attempt to fill in 
        the details left as exercises in the lectures. These lectures, by Dhruv Ranganathan, and Tony Scholl,  were my first introduction to 
        algebraic geometry, and are thus written from the perspective of someone slowly understanding 
        the geometric content in scheme theory.  Many comparisons are drawn to the theory of smooth 
        manifolds, as I was at one point much more comfortable with the language of differential geometry 
        than schemes.<br><br>

        These notes have taken on a life of their own since my days at Cambridge, now covering far more than the original 
        lecture series while still omitting much content that I plan to include in the future (in fact, the current 
         draft says nothing of abelian varieties).
         Since these began as personal notes, I have done a terrible 
        job at citing references; hopefully I will fix this one day. At the moment I have drawn mainly  
        from the stacks projects, Vakil's Rising sea, Hartshorne, and Liu's Algebraic Geometry 
        and Arithmetic Curves. The topics are presented in an order that makes the most sense to me, though I recognize 
        it may not be the most natural presentation. I am unsure if there 
        will ever be a point where I will say these notes are finished.
      </span></li><br>
      <li><a href="Geometry of Gauge Theory" target="_blank">The Geometry of Gauge Theory</a> <span style="font-style: italic;">
        This is my undergraduate honors thesis which I wrote under the supervision of Matt Szczesny in my final year at Boston University. 
        It was an ambitious project, with the goal of starting at the definition of a smooth manifold, and 
        building up to the construction of the Yang-Mills-Dirac Lagrangian on a pseudo Riemannian manifold. It was heavily inspired 
        by Mark Hamilton's Mathematical Gauge Theory, and Lee's Smooth Manifolds. I would say this project is 90% finished; at some point 
        I hope to add a final chapter on gauge theory and general relativity.
